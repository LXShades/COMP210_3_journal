	abstract = {Eye-movement tracking is a method that is increasingly being employed to study usability issues in HCI contexts. The objectives of the present chapter are threefold. First, we introduce the reader to the basics of eye-movement technology, and also present key aspects of practical guidance to those who might be interested in using eye tracking in HCI research, whether in usability-evaluation studies, or for capturing people's eye movements as an input mechanism to drive system interaction. Second, we examine various ways in which eye movements can be systematically measured to examine interface usability. We illustrate the advantages of a range of different eye-movement metrics with reference to state-of-the-art usability research. Third, we discuss the various opportunities for eye-movement studies in future HCI research, and detail some of the challenges that need to be overcome to enable effective application of the technique in studying the complexities of advanced interactive-system use.},

	abstract = {Evolutions in eye tracking systems and their distinct applications have led to their increased use in almost every field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). However, cost, setup and availability hinder the integration of these systems with daily use. This paper presents an infrared based detection technique to resist the ambient light variations, and combines scanning of a neighbourhood of 10Ã—10 pixels and blob analysis to generate a gaze vector to calculate the gaze position. The main goal of this paper is to create a low cost and easy-to-setup webcam-based eye tracker that requires no calibration and using it as an assistive technology for young children with autism as a digital communication medium for a session of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA).},

	abstract = {The trend of Natural User Interface (NUI) has gradually accepted by global users and expanded its market demand. Eye tracking technology provided valuable NUI information on user's eye behavior and made NUI become a more effective and precise interactive interface for human research. At present, there are still many limits of eye tracking technology including costs and accuracy. Our major study projects aim to design and develop low cost but accurate eye tracker devises involving image recognition, calibration, infrared LED, natural light, and many other applications. This study used OpenSource eye tracking software with self-developed interfaces and attached a commercially available cameras outside to make eye tracker system a set of recording and analysis system. The experiment found an acceptable accuracy range of about 1.2 degrees of eye angle error rate, where high accuracy studies often not required or achieved. Low cost and better accuracy eye trackers could help NUI achieve to the next level of an innovative user interface.},

	abstract = {This study compared three methods of collecting survey data about sexual behaviors and other sensitive topics: computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), computer-assisted self-administered interviewing (CASI), and audio computer-assisted self-administered interviewing (ACASI). Interviews were conducted with an area probability sample of more than 300 adults in Cook County, Illinois. The experiment also compared open and closed questions about the number of sex partners and varied the context in which the sex partner itemswere embeded. The three mode groups did not differ in response rates, but the mode of data collection did affect the level of reporting of sensitive behaviors: both forms of self-administration tended to reduce the disparity between men and women in the number of sex partners reported. Self-administration, especially via ACASI, also increased the proportion of respondents admitting that they had used illicit drugs. In addition, when the closed answer options emphasized the low end of the distribution, fewer sex partners were reported than when the options emphasized the high end of the distribution; responses to the open-ended versions of the sex partner items generally fell between responses to the two closed versions.},

To collect the most accurate data from respondents, investigators must understand and be able to prevent or at least minimize bias in the design of their questionnaires. This paper identifies and categorizes 48 types of bias in questionnaires based on a review of the literature and offers an example of each type. The types are categorized according to three main sources of bias: the way a question is designed, the way the questionnaire as a whole is designed, and how the questionnaire is administered. This paper is intended to help investigators in public health understand the mechanism and dynamics of problems in questionnaire design and to provide a checklist for identifying potential bias in a questionnaire before it is administered.},

	abstract = {Because of its sound psychometric properties the SF-36 General Health Questionnaire is used throughout the world, yet it is difficult to analyse and score. Using a newly developed software package, onto which any questionnaire can be loaded, we developed an electronic version of the SF-36 General Health Questionnaire. The purpose of this study is test the effect of the electronic mode of administration on the measurement properties of the SF-36. In a randomised cross-over design study 79 healthy individuals and 36 chronic pain patients completed both electronic and paper versions of the SF-36. Seventy-one percent preferred the electronic SF-36, 7\% stated no preference, and 22\% preferred the paper version. Completion time for the electronic SF-36 was slightly less, and there were no missing or problematical responses, whereas 44\% of participants had at least one missing or problematical response in the paper version. Data entry and auditing time was 8 hours. There was less than 4\% inter-version difference for any of the SF-36 sub-scales. The electronic SF-36 was well accepted and slightly quicker to complete than the paper version. We conclude that the electronic SF-36 is equivalent in performance and more effective than the paper version.},

Previous research has examined the visual attention devoted to the 10 organic search results, and we extend this by also examining how gaze is distributed across other components of contemporary search engines, such as ads and related searches. This provides insights about searcher's interactions with the "whole page", and not just individual components. In addition, we used clustering techniques to identify groups of individuals, with distinct gaze patterns. The groups varied in how exhaustively they examined the search results and in what regions of the search result page they paid most attention to (organic results vs. ads). These results further our understanding of how attention is distributed across increasingly complex search result pages, and how individuals exhibit distinct patterns of attention and interaction.},
